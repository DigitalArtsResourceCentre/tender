        <h1>Five Minutes of Blue Oyster Mushrooms Talking</h1>
        <p>Through the use of bio data sonification and a eurorack synthesizer we are able to listen in as two blocks of oyster mushrooms talk for perhaps the first time. This is the first time they have ever touched, but as you can see even when they are pulled apart at the end of the video they are still able to pass a small amount of signal through grow bags into the stainless steel table.</p>
        <p>The eurorack module instruo scion was used to achieve the bio data sonification. It is a module specifically designed for this purpose and converts changes in resistance into analog control signals for the synthesizer.</p>
