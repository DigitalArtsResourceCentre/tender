        <h1>Hossein Khodabakhsh</h1>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Hossein Khodabakhsh is an Iranian photographer and artist who has been interested in documentary photography for most of his career. His recent work fuses digital media and photography to create augmented reality counter-monuments through digital manipulation and interpretation. Regarding his winning submission, Khodabakhsh says: “Against Communal Amnesia is a counter monument for organized crimes committed by the Islamic government in my country, Iran, after the 1979 revolution. Ambiguous 3D models are made from Google Earth images of a crime scene from the time of the crime until today through a digital process. The objects are combined with the real image of the crime scenes to tell the story of the land and to cause the audience questions and curiosity. My images are a stimulus for people to remember, a warrior to resist amnesia, and anyone who calls for amnesia.” In 2021, Khodabakhsh was the grand prize winner of the NSCAD Student Art Award.</p>
