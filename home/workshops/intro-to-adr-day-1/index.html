        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
          “The embrace of the imagination always has specific political implications. To quote the
          French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, every work of art is a step toward a “minoritarian
          history of the world” (Toward a Minor Literature, G. Deleuze and F. Guattari). Rah’s
          experimental cinema blends a heady mix of philosophical ideas, parody, and overt
          allegory. In her work Oreo she highlights the boundary between identity and the
          perception of the Self, developing her own highly individualistic visual language.”
          -CineWomen Cahier, Paris, 2015 </p>

          Rah was also the only Iranian-Canadian artist in SAW Galleries Ciphers: Tension with
          Tradition in Contemporary Iranian Photography which was curated by PhD. Andrea D.
          Fitzpatrick and was a first-of-its-kind exhibition of Iran’s most critically acclaimed
          lens-based artists. Later that year, Rah’s video Eslah, 2012, was published in Art
          Journal, Vol. 8, a scholarly article written by PhD. Francine Dagenais and was published
          in Tehran, Iran. Most recently, CineWomen Cahier, a biennial publication based out of
          Paris dedicated a twelve-page spread to Rah’s work Oreo. Rah’s work has been
          published and exhibited in galleries and museums internationally.
          Rah is represented by Vtape, Canada’s leading artist-run distributor for video art.
