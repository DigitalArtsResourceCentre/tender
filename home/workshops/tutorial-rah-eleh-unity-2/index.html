        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>“The embrace of the imagination always has specific political implications. To quote the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, every work of art is a step toward a “minoritarian history of the world” (Toward a Minor Literature, G. Deleuze and F. Guattari). Rah’s experimental cinema blends a heady mix of philosophical ideas, parody, and overt allegory. In her work Oreo she highlights the boundary between identity and the perception of the Self, developing her own highly individualistic visual language.” -CineWomen Cahier, Paris, 2015</p>
