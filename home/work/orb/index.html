          I
        </h2>
        <p>
          The day it appeared I was washing the dishes. I went upstairs to check on Mia.
          I had put her down to nap but the light was still on in her room. When I switched it off, a faint vibration
          remained. It seemed to be coming from outside.
          It was dusk when I stepped into the front yard.
          I stopped.
          Hovering in front of me was an object we came to call the Orb. It was three feet in diameter, a silver
          metallic ball suspended in mid-air at the same height as my shoulder.
          It didn't move. But I could almost see a tremor around it, like when heat shimmers on pavement.
          I ran back inside the house. It seems ridiculous to say this now, but I locked the door and ran upstairs to
          check on Mia. She was in her bed, sleeping soundly. I drew back the curtains of her window. The orb
          was still there. From above it had the same silver shimmer like it was breathing.
          My phone rang. I let it ring. I didn't dare leave Mia's room, but kept my eyes fixed on the object below.
          Finally, after several minutes, it vanished.
        </p>
        <h2>
          II
        </h2>
        <p>
          Later that evening we sat at the table and talked about what we had experienced. You from your office,
          me from our home.
          Your Orb had been blue-tinged, and from your description, it seemed smaller than mine. But you said
          that when you worked up the courage to go outside and look more closely at it, that it seemed to change
          from blue to silver. We discussed the possibility that we had seen the same Sphere in two different
          places at once.
          Other reports flooded in. Text messages from friends I hadn't heard from in years. The news touted
          scientific theories: A new war technology that had landed in our country from the conflict overseas.
          Drones. A surveillance device.
          Others suggested it was a UFO. Or a visitor from another dimension.
          The next day you left for the South. Mia clung to your legs as I hugged you goodbye at the front door.
          Then your car was pulling out of the driveway. The tug of anxiety that I usually felt when you went off
          for an extended work period was amplified by worry that the Orb would reappear.

          My sister visited. She shifted in her seat, squinting up at me as I made the tea, looking slightly irritated
          at my account.
          She waited til I had finished, then set her tea cup down on the table.
          “You don't mean to tell me that you believe that? The Orbs don't actually exist. I mean, they're not
          real.”
          My jaw went slack. I inclined my head and peered through the kitchen window, remembering what I'd
          seen that afternoon. Remembering what you and I had discussed. The news accounts, the frightened
          text messages.
          “It's a conspiracy,” she continued. “Some tech mogul in San Francisco created them. They're
          holograms.”
          “But - why?” I asked.
          She continued impatiently. “They want to distract us from the war. It's a tactic. So we don't get upset
          about all the killing.”
          We didn't speak for several minutes. The sunlight in the yard faded until only grey light remained. I
          took the empty tea cups and placed them in the sink.
          When my sister got back into her car and drove away, my world had changed for the second time that
          week.

        </h2>
        <p>
          You returned from the South. You were tired and you didn't want to talk that evening so I let it go. All
          of the questions that had been mounting since my sister's visit remained crowded inside my head.
          Finally, I found the courage to ask you: Do you believe the story? About the holograms?
          You were defensive at first. You'd heard the story that the Orbs were just projections. And despite
          having witnessed the object directly – the mystical feeling you had described of experiencing
          something beyond your ability to understand – you'd latched onto this as the truth.
          That moment my heart broke. You and I would never feel the same way again.
        </p>
        <h2>
          V
        </h2>
        <p>
          Tuesday, I went to see Meg.
          She laughed. She's not afraid of what's happening. She thinks that people can't accept the fact that we're
          no longer alone. That we can no longer escape the moral responsibility to all the inhabitants on this
          planet. She says that's the true story.

          “Then it would stop being us and them always. There would be a third party to consider.”
          “There could still be an 'us and them',” I said.
          Meg exhaled slowly.
          “You're right. So maybe it's better this way. We can't destroy what we don't believe exists, can we?”
          After that conversation, I drove myself crazy trying to hold both ideas in my mind at the same time.
          Could you and Meg both be right?
        </p>

          VI

        <p>
          I'm not trying to put Mia between us. She can believe what she wishes. When she was four, she told us
          she was vegetarian and we made the necessary changes. I'm not trying to persuade her one way or the
          other. But you say that since the last time she stayed with me I've coloured her thinking.
          I still search for them in the landscape. I still see them in the landscape, though fewer and fewer of us
          claim to.
