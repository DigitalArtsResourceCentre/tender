          <p>
            BRUTALISM FOR BIRDS is a site-specific augmented reality work for
            the postal service by Kel MacDonald and Seth Thomson, created for
            DARC’s Tender Circuits project (2022). It considers notions of home
            and community through the interwoven systems of housing, hostile
            architecture, and urban ecology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Viewers interact with BRUTALISM FOR BIRDS by sending or receiving an
            AR postcard, which depicts a locked and gated undeveloped urban
            green space at the corner of Metcalfe and Glouscester in Ottawa,
            Ontario. When viewed through the Artivive mobile application, the
            postcard comes alive with an AR video of the site, featuring a 3D
            modelled birdhouse floating in the sky, surrounded by a murmuration
            of birds. The loss of the London Arms Apartments and the site’s lack
            of redevelopment has worsened the availability of housing throughout
            the neighbourhood. While this space could easily be perceived as
            neutral to a casual passerby, its hostile lack of architecture
            exacerbates Ottawa’s housing crisis. BRUTALISM FOR BIRDS invites
            viewers to imagine alternative possibilities for the site.

          <h2>Long Summary</h2>
          <p>
            BRUTALISM FOR BIRDS is a site-specific augmented reality work for
            the postal service by Kel MacDonald and Seth Thomson. It was created
            in response to DARC’s Tender Circuits AR call for projects to
            “consider the nature of the connections that encircle and extend a
            mycelial system and to investigate the possibility of applying
            fungal characteristics to human and more-than-human community
            building at the intersection of digital and physical spaces.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Fungal networks have developed a form of communication - a language
            comprised of pulses transmitted through “nerves” through which nodes
            in a mycelial network can exchange information. When one mushroom is
            damaged, it can provide warning about the threat to all of the other
            mushrooms in the network. BRUTALISM FOR BIRDS imagines a similar
            information network being applied to the residential landscape of
            downtown Ottawa – the loss of one housing development transmitting a
            warning through a network to the other residences in the
            neighborhood. Birds, similarly, form a collective swarm intelligence
            to facilitate migration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Viewers interact with BRUTALISM FOR BIRDS by sending or receiving an
            AR postcard, which depicts a locked and gated undeveloped urban
            green space at the corner of Metcalfe and Glouscester in Ottawa’s
            Centretown neighbourhood. It is formerly the site of the London Arms
            Apartments, a 49-unit apartment complex torn down in 2017. When
            viewed through the Artivive mobile application, the postcard comes
            alive with an AR video of the gated green space, featuring a 3D
            modelled birdhouse floating in the sky, surrounded by a murmuration
            of birds. The project superimposes this murmuration of birds,
            perpetually circling a birdhouse which they will never enter, into
            the vacant space – former housing which displaced residents cannot
            return to, an empty lot which for years has seen no use save for a
            small pedestrian walkway. The birds’ flight path is informed by
            audio recordings of urban noise taken on location containing both
            traffic noise and birdsong, a blend of man-made and natural sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            BRUTALISM FOR BIRDS considers notions of home and community through
            the interwoven systems of housing, hostile architecture, and urban
            ecology. It is informed, in part, by our shared lived experiences of
            housing insecurity. In relation to the fungal intelligence, we
            employed postcards as the distribution method for this work,
            considering the postal system a network in which information can be
            transmitted from any place, but only received at a fixed address. A
            postcard, then, becomes a means through which information can be
            conveyed by those with similar housing instability to those who are
            secure – the same process by which a mycelium will warn its own
            network of dangers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The loss of the London Arms Apartments and the site’s lack of
            redevelopment has worsened the availability of housing throughout
            the neighbourhood. While this space could easily be perceived as
            neutral to a casual passerby, its hostile lack of architecture
            exacerbates Ottawa’s housing crisis. BRUTALISM FOR BIRDS invites
            viewers to imagine alternative possibilities for the site beyond its
            existence as a gated, inaccessible green space.
          </p>
          <p>
            BRUTALISM FOR BIRDS postcards are available by post or at select
            locations in Ottawa’s Centretown or Lowertown neighborhoods.
