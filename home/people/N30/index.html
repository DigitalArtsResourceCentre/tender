        <p>
          Having been born in an uncertain future, N30 practices digital alchemy in the creation of immersive
          environments, resorting to a mix of developing tech and analog art using different materials. His codified
          language is based on evolution and computational geometry, abstractions and bio-organic forms, as he creates
          images inspired in science fiction.
          â€‹</p>
          <p>
          N30 is a pioneer in the research and development of VR & AR for Google MX & the Guanajuato International Film
          Festival (GIFF). He has developed projects in the field of psychology and talk therapy using art as a tool; he
          formed part of the CONACULTA program providing guidance and training for young people living in high-risk
          areas. More recently, he has been part of the VR Metaverse Developer Team, and collaborated on projects for
          Microsoft, Burning Man and Mutek.
